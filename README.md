The Triple Encryption Encoder/Decoder Program written in Python, encrypts a message in Morse Code, Tap Code, and Caeser Cipher Shift 16. Currently having some trouble debugging the program and finding a fix to our problem. The encoder works fine, although the decoder on the other hand doesn't seem to properly translate the message.
